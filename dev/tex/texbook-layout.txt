over (fraction) ###

the numerator and denominator are placed at a fixed position relative to the baseline (not axis!).
the denominators target-position is downwards for positive values!

this position depends on the current style: 
num1 and denom1: if display-style
num2 and denom2: otherwise

there is a certain axis-height and rule-thickness. 
the minimal allowed spacing between both nodes and the rule-stroke is 3*rulethickness if 
display-style and 1*rulethickness if inline-style. 
the spacing between numerator and the rule-stroke will be the distance from the bottom
of the numerator to the top of the rule (axisheight + rule-thickness / 2).

position the numerator and denominator, but if the spacing is violated, shift the nodes up/down 
to preserve the spacing. 

position of numerator: top(rule) + max(position(num) - depth(num) - top(rule), halfRuleThickness)



atop (binomial) ###

minimal-spacing: 7*default_rule_thickness if display-style, otherwise: 3*default_rule_thickness
use the same target-positions as in fractions. 
if the spacing between the nodes is smaller than the minimal-spacing, shift both nodes by the 
same amount until the spacing is correct.
